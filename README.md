# Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
# Introduction 
Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal by looking for instances that seem to fit least to the remainder of the data set

# How to implemenation? 
1. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
